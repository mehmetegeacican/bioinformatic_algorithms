The following describes how to run the program step by step

STEP1: Please go to the directory where the source code(main.py) is located

STEP2: Add the desired text file that contains a specific motif length and a pattern to the directory.(Note: input0.txt,input1.txt,input2.txt that were given are already in there)

STEP3: After, in the terminal, go to directory where main.py and the input files are located

STEP4: type 'make' if you are using linux, else type -> python main.py -i input.txt
(NOTE: You can use your own input file as well, just make sure that it is in the directory)
(NOTE: If you are using linux,Since there is no build stage in python, the codes test.py and main.py automatically runs. test.py just tests the search method with the input files that are already contained(input0.txt,input1.txt) prints the outputs and puts the outputs into specific outputfiles(output0.txt,output1.txt,output2.txt).)
